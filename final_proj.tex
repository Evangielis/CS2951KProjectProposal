\section{Research question}
How facial expression convey implicit message and influence the explicit message received?

\section{Significance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Adjust the machine strategy/action accordingly. 

For example, strong negative emotion would trigger error detection/correction mechanism; faster convergence in computation to give back prompt feedback; alternative strategy in search space or algorithm for the solution.

\item Alarm and report emergency for drivers, employees and patients.

\item Improve user experience. The robots are more than our workers; they can be truly thoughtful and understanding companions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}



\subsection{How to solve the problem?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Obtain facial expression data from Intel RealSense.
\item Construct POMDP model for emotion, action and transition.
\item Solve the decision problem using Bayes filter.
\item Test the model by user input from class and friends.
\item Adjust and formalize the model. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to know if we have solved the problem?}
\emph{Milestone 1.} Successful detection of user facial expression using Intel RealSense camera and based on that, inference of emotion.

\emph{Milestone 2.} Formalized POMDP model that outputs decision from input user expression and inferred emotion.

\emph{Milestone 3.} Extensive testing (hoping) to justify the performance of Intel RealSense emtion inference, our POMDP model and the output decision.

\emph{Final results.} We have solved the problem if testing indicates that we can make satisfiable decision given user input facial expression and commands.
